so what are the things we want to

project 1: End to End data pipeline
start on Monday 9/25
duration is 10-15 days(2-3 weeks)
End-to-end pipeline

part 1
	1. connect spark from a database(Postgres) using both scala and python
	2. transformation on spark
	3. incremental load into Hive


part 2
	1. get data from API using Scala
	2. load into Kafka topic
	3. read from Kafka topic using python/pyspark
	4. process data into pyspark
	5. load into hive or HBase
	6. build data flow using Nifi

part 3
	1. create a machine learning prediction model using Pyspark
	2. Deploy the complete pipeline using Jenkins, docker, and Kubernetes
	3. create BI(business intelligence) dashboard using superset

Action Items
	1. work with connectivity with Postgres using spark
		-one works with Scala
		-one works with python
	2. work with different types of transformations
		-find 10 different transformations
	3. connecting Kafka with API and load the data into Kafka
		-getting data from Kafka
		-loading it into hive or Hbase using pyspark
	4. machine learning prediction model 
		-find historical dataset (2-3 years)
		-create a prediction model in Hive using historical data we pulled in
		-get real-time data from Kafka to put in a trained prediction model
	5. automate using Jenkins, Kubernetes, and docker
	6. create a dashboard in a superset

Things we have done:
database name: fraud_project
table_name: fraud_table

Extra_notes:
from postgres using sqoop load to hdfs

create hive table

automate to oozie

Incremental load from spark

create api

read csv, and make to api json

once api created

get that api in scala

parse api json in scala


Example project topics
first batch
	- API from flight, get flight delay prediction

second batch
	- stock price prediction

third batch
	- train delay prediction

fourth batch
	- heart disease prediction

fifth batch
	- bitcoin




15-day sprint
initiative for scrum master
	-organize tasks and subtasks,
	-pick jira or alternative free account(4-5 members))

The team lead will technical architecture
	-where we are going, issues faced, assign tasks, monitor tasks
	-takes updates from the team
		-progress
		-what has been done
		-who has done what



project 2: next project in cloud service
